go-angularjs
------------
A wrapper for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to be used with [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

*This project is in a very early stage and help is very welcome, because I am already quite busy with improving GopherJS itself. Please contact me at mail@richard-musiol.de if you are interested in leading this project.*
